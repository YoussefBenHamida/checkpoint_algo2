I did not understand the Hash Table. 
Uh, so, a Hash Table... It's like this thing where you put stuff, right? But it's not just any stuff, it's like... data stuff. And instead of, you know, putting things in order like alphabetically or whatever, it's more like throwing everything into these... uh... buckets? Yeah, buckets. And then, um, there's this thing called hashing, which is like... I think it's some kind of magic math? Anyway, the Hash Table uses this hashing thing to decide where to put your stuff. But, like, it's all jumbled up, you know? So if you want to find something, you have to do... stuff. I'm not really sure what, but something to do with numbers and... I dunno, hoping for the best? And sometimes, like, your stuff might crash into other stuff and cause a mess. But, uh, yeah, Hash Tables are... interesting, I guess.
